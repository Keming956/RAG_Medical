attack in Başkale. The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front organized its first suicide attack on 3 January 2001 in Istanbul. On 15 November 2003, Al-Qaeda organized its first suicide attack in the country, using bomb-laden vehicles on two separate targets in Istanbul and targeted places of worship for the first time. On 20 November, the same organization attacked two different targets in Istanbul using the same method, again with a few minutes apart. 28 people died in the first attack and 31 in the second one, making those attacks the deadliest suicide attacks in the country at that time. On 6 January 2015, a suicide attack was carried out in Istanbul by a person linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. An assailant, who was affiliated with the same organization, killed 34 people in the attack on Suruç on 20 July 2015. On 10 October 2015, 109 people died in Ankara due to explosives detonated by two people at an interval of three seconds, and this event went down

On 10 October 2015, 109 people died in Ankara due to explosives detonated by two people at an interval of three seconds, and this event went down in history as the most fatal suicide attack in the history of the country. On 17 February 2016, a suicide attack was carried out in Ankara by TAK members for the first time. An airport in Turkey was targeted for the first time in the attack on Istanbul Atatürk Airport on 28 June 2016.

C.  Although there were no suicide attacks in 2004, two people that were injured in the attacks that took place in Istanbul on 15 and 20 November 2003 died from their injuries in 2004.
D.  Two people who were fatally injured on 10 December 2016 due to the attack in Istanbul, lost their lives in 2017 and 2019 respectively.

Perpetrator
Six people, including three foreigners, were detained over the attack.

On January 7, the far-left armed group Revolutionary People's Liberation Party–Front (DHKP/C) claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was meant ""to punish (the) murderers of Berkin Elvan"" and ""to call to account the fascist state that protects AKP's corrupt, stealing ministers"". Berkin Elvan was a 15-year-old boy who was killed by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during the 2013 Istanbul protests. The bombing came five days after another member of DHKP/C attacked police on guard outside the Ottoman-era Dolmabahçe Palace, hurling two grenades that failed to explode. The building houses the Istanbul offices of the Turkish prime minister.

The group also claimed that the suicide bomber was Elif Sultan Kalsen. After being called to a criminal medical center to identify the body, Kalsen's family denied the claims, stating that it was not their daughter.

Insomnia is a 1994 horror/fantasy novel by American writer Stephen King. It follows retired widower Ralph Roberts whose increasing insomnia allows him to perceive auras and other hidden things, leading him to join a conflict between the forces of the Purpose and the Random. Like It and Dreamcatcher, the story is set in the fictional town of Derry, Maine. It includes connections to other Stephen King stories, particularly his novel series The Dark Tower.

Plot 
The story is set in the fictional town of Derry, Maine. Retiree Ralph Roberts encounters his formerly good-natured acquaintance Ed Deepneau at the local airfield. Ed is aggressive and swearing obscenely at a driver he accuses of secretly transporting fetal tissue from abortions. Some months later, Ralph (now a widower) encounters Ed's wife Helen who has been badly beaten by her husband after having signed a pro-choice related petition. Months later, Helen leaves Ed and hides at a women's shelter.

Insomnia is a 1997 Norwegian thriller film about a police detective investigating a murder in a town located above the Arctic Circle. The investigation goes horribly wrong when he mistakenly shoots his partner and subsequently attempts to cover up his bungle. The title of the film refers to his inability to sleep, the result of his guilt (represented by the relentless glare of the midnight sun). Insomnia was the film debut of director Erik Skjoldbjærg. The screenplay was written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Skjoldbjærg, and the soundtrack by Geir Jenssen.

The film inspired the 2002 American remake Insomnia.

Plot

Insomnia, also known as sleeplessness, is a sleep disorder in which people have trouble sleeping. They may have difficulty falling asleep, or staying asleep as long as desired. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. It may result in an increased risk of motor vehicle collisions, as well as problems focusing and learning. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month.

Production
The idea for the site was conceived by Sweeney, who is head of the NFB's French-language Digital Studio, when he became a father for the first time in the summer of 2009. Sweeney was often up at night with his wife due to his infant daughter's irregular sleep patterns and found himself wondering about all the other people who also might be up at this hour, and the impact of sleeplessness on their lives. As one of NFB French Program's main areas of interest is works related to mental health, Sweeney began to imagine what a webdoc on insomnia might be like. The NFB worked with Montreal-based web design firm Akufen to create A Journal of Insomnia.

Insomnia is a sleep disorder.

Insomnia is a 1994 horror/fantasy novel by American writer Stephen King. It follows retired widower Ralph Roberts whose increasing insomnia allows him to perceive auras and other hidden things, leading him to join a conflict between the forces of the Purpose and the Random. Like It and Dreamcatcher, the story is set in the fictional town of Derry, Maine. It includes connections to other Stephen King stories, particularly his novel series The Dark Tower.

Plot 
The story is set in the fictional town of Derry, Maine. Retiree Ralph Roberts encounters his formerly good-natured acquaintance Ed Deepneau at the local airfield. Ed is aggressive and swearing obscenely at a driver he accuses of secretly transporting fetal tissue from abortions. Some months later, Ralph (now a widower) encounters Ed's wife Helen who has been badly beaten by her husband after having signed a pro-choice related petition. Months later, Helen leaves Ed and hides at a women's shelter.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a technique for treating insomnia without (or alongside) medications. Insomnia is a common problem involving trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting quality sleep. CBT-I aims to improve sleep habits and behaviors by identifying  and changing the thoughts and the behaviors that affect the ability of a person to sleep or sleep well.

The first step in treating insomnia with CBT-I is to identify the underlying causes of insomnia. People with insomnia should evaluate or have their sleep patterns evaluated and take into account all possible factors that may be affecting the person's ability to sleep. This would involve keeping a sleep diary/journal for a couple of weeks. The journal will help to identify patterns of thoughts or behaviors, stressors, etc. that could be contributing to the person's insomnia.

Nichtorganische Psychosen 
Erkrankungen mit nichtorganischen (ähnliche Bezeichnungen auch endogene oder funktionelle) Psychosen umfassen:
 Schizophrenie bzw. Erkrankungen des schizophrenen Formenkreises,
 Anhaltende wahnhafte Störung (:en:Delusional disorder),
 Akute oder vorübergehende psychotische Störungen (:en:Brief psychotic disorder),
 Induzierte wahnhafte Störung,
 Schizoaffektive Störung,
 affektive Psychosen (hierunter fallen manche Formen von bipolarer Störung oder schwerer Depression).

Karl Leonhard hat sechs Hauptgruppen der endogenen Psychosen unterschieden:

 Die drei phasischen Psychosen (ohne die Zykloiden):
 Unipolare Manien
 Unipolare Depressionen
 Bipolare Krankheit

 Die zykloiden Psychosen: Angst-Glücks-Psychose, Erregt-gehemmte Verwirrtheitspsychose, Hyperkinetisch-akinetische Motilitätspsychose
 Die unsystematischen Schizophrenien: Affektvolle Paraphrenie, periodische Katatonie etc.
 Die systematischen Schizophrenien: Katatonien, Hebephrenien und Paraphrenien.

Dabei sollten die zykloiden Psychosen eine gute Prognose haben und „defektfrei“ ausheilen.

Klassifikation psychotischer Erkrankungen 
Zur Klassifikation psychiatrischer Erkrankungen insgesamt dominierte historisch das Triadische System, dessen Entwicklung auf den Psychiater Emil Kraepelin zurückgeht. Das Triadische System teilt die Psychosen in organische (körperlich begründbare) und endogene („nicht körperlich begründbare“) Psychosen ein. Eine weitere Unterteilung der endogenen Psychosen erfolgte 1899 in der 6. Auflage von Kraepelins psychiatrischen Lehrbuchs, worin er die Dementia praecox (durch Eugen Bleuler später Schizophrenie genannt) dem manisch-depressiven Irresein (Bipolare Störung) gegenüberstellte. Das Triadische System dominierte die Psychiatrie bis in die 1980er-Jahre hinein, als mit der Veröffentlichung von DSM-III bzw. ICD-10 ein Paradigmenwechsel erfolgte: Eine ätiologisch motivierte Einteilung der Erkrankungen wurde aufgegeben, der Fokus verschob sich auf eine deskriptive Einteilung mit Einbeziehung des Verlaufs einer Erkrankung (Zeitkriterium).

Die Zuordnung ist jedoch je nach Autor als unterschiedlich anzusehen. Manfred Bleuler zählte nur noch die Schizophrenie zu den endogenen Psychosen. Die ICD-10-Klassifikation gebraucht die Bezeichnung endogen nur noch im Zusammenhang mit endogener Depression. Mit dem Begriff endogene Psychose werden organische Psychosen als „exogen“ aus der Gruppe der Psychosen nosologisch ausgeschlossen. Nach der Einteilung des triadischen Systems der Psychiatrie sind auch die Variationen seelischen Wesens (Neurosen und Persönlichkeitsstörungen) als weitestgehend „psychogen“ bzw. als „nicht psychotisch“ abgegrenzt. Endogen bedeutet daher im Sinne der Abgrenzung von organischen Psychosen so viel wie „nicht-somatisch“ und im Sinne der Abgrenzung von Neurosen und Persönlichkeitsstörungen so viel wie „nicht-psychogen“.(a) Im Gegensatz dazu wird der eindeutig biologistische Standpunkt des Krankheitskonzepts als „noch nicht genau erwiesene“, aber hypostasierte Krankheitsursache betont.(a)

Bestätigungen 
Die für die Psychiatrie in der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts aufgestellten naturwissenschaftlichen Grundannahmen erfuhren durch folgende Kriterien eine Bestätigung.

Körperliche Wirkstoffe 
Zur körperlichen Begründbarkeit bei der Auslösung psychotischer Störungen ist die Rolle körperlicher Agenzien, wie Alkohol, Drogen oder höhere Dosen von Cortison allgemein bekannt. Psychotische Störungen können etwa auch durch Hirninfektionen (z. B. bakteriell) ausgelöst werden (Somatogenese). Auch wenn diese Auslösung weitestgehend als „exogen“ zu bezeichnen ist, so wirft sie doch ein prinzipielles Licht auf die evtl. auch für endogene Psychosen ursächlich zugrundeliegenden Stoffwechselvorgänge.

Psychopharmaka

Differenzialtypologie gegen andere psychische Störungen 
Sodann erfolgt die Abgrenzung der Schizophrenie gegen andere psychische Störungen. Die Abgrenzung gegen andere Psychosen, insbesondere gegenüber den affektiven Störungen, bezeichnet man nach K. Schneider nicht als Differenzialdiagnose, sondern als Differenzialtypologie, da die Ursache der Schizophrenie unbekannt ist. Hier kommen an erster Stelle in Frage die:

 Anhaltende wahnhafte Störung (F 22)
 Akute Psychose (F23)
 Schizoaffektive Störung (F25)

Sowie die affektiven Psychosen:

 Depression mit psychotischen Symptomen (F32/33)
 Manie oder bipolare Störung mit psychotischen Symptomen (F30/31)

Das der heutigen Psychiatrie geläufige Spektrum der „Endogenen Psychosen“ sieht eine Gruppe von Erkrankungen vor, die erstmals Robert Gaupp in der oben zitierten Arbeit als „Mischpsychose“ bezeichnet hatte und die heute als „Schizoaffektive Psychosen“ bekannt sind (ICD-10 F 25). Diese Erkrankungen unterscheiden sich nicht nur in ihrem Querschnittsbild, sondern auch in ihrem Verlauf und der Prognose. Obwohl diese Tatsachen schon in den 1920er Jahren in der Psychiatrie hinlänglich bekannt waren, änderte sich an der Hospitalisierungspraxis schizophrener Patienten nichts. Retrospektive Untersuchungen zeigten, dass in den 1930er Jahren 40–50 % der schizophrenen Patienten länger als fünf Jahre hospitalisiert waren.

        Question: Based on the following text about mental health or psychological disorders, generate a clinically relevant question that could be answered by the text:
Endogene Psychose war eine in der klassischen deutschen Psychiatrie maßgebliche Sammelbezeichnung für bestimmte psychische Krankheiten (Psychosen) mit vermuteten endogenen Ursachen. Man nahm an, dass diese Erkrankungen vor allem durch eine innere Konstitution verursacht würden und weniger durch äußere Einflüsse. Psychiatriegeschichtlich wurden hierzu meist gezählt:(a)
 schizophrene Psychosen (heute Schizophrenie)
 manisch-depressive Psychosen (heute bipolare Störungen)
 affektive Psychosen
 genuin epileptische Psychosen (heute genetisch bedingte Epilepsien)
 psychische Dysfunktionen in der Arbeit
 Psychische Krankheiten
