Reception
Don Towers reviewed Paranoia Form Pack in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 83. Towers commented that "You should be selective as to whether you want to include this accessory into your games. The humor might wear off too quickly to be of lasting value, whereas the money spent on the usually well-written modules is of better value."
