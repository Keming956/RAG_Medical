Anxiety Always is an album released by the Detroit, Michigan electronic duo ADULT. in September 2003.  Although the band had released the album Resuscitation in 2001, this release is considered to be their true full-length debut album, as Resuscitation was essentially a compilation of past single releases.

ADULT. consists of instrumentalist Adam Lee Miller and vocalist Nicola Kuperus.  Kuperus is also a visual artist and provided the album's cover art photography.  Upon its release Anxiety Always received positive reviews from critics, who praised the duo's expansion of their mostly-synthesizer-based sound, as the album contains prominent guitar and bass guitar elements.

Anxiety Always was released independently by Miller and Kurperus on their Ersatz Audio record label.
