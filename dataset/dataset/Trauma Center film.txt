Synopsis
In San Juan, Puerto Rico, Madison Taylor (Nicky Whelan) is injured when she's caught in the crossfire of two corrupt cops, Pierce (Tito Ortiz) and Tull (Texas Battle).

Madison wakes up in a hospital and as a witness of one of their vicious crimes, sheâ€™s placed under the protection of respected police lieutenant Steve Wakes (Bruce Willis). Madison's misfortune turns into a real nightmare when Pierce and Tull turn up to finish the job, realizing she is the key to tracing them back to the crime.
