On 10 August 2015, a suicide bombing occurred in the Kabul International Airport street, near the entrance to Kabul Airport, killing five people and wounding 16 people. This occurred days after a series of suicide attacks in the Afghan capital killed dozens and wounded hundreds.

The bombing occurred when a suicide bomber drove a vehicle into the first checkpoint on the road into the airport. The people that died included four civilians and a child.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, and said it was intended to target a group of foreigners.
