Reception 
Daniel W. Foster, writing for the Journal of Clinical Investigation, stated that Every Patient Tells a Story is "well written, and while it may be a little too technical at times for nonmedical readers and not quite scientific enough at times for physicians, both audiences will likely enjoy it." Pauline Chen reviewed the book for The New York Times, noting that Sanders "takes readers on an examination of the tools of diagnosis, touching upon the obvious and the not-so-obvious".
