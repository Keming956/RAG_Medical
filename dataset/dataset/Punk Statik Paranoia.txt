Punk Statik Paranoia is the third album by the industrial rock band Orgy. It was released on February 24, 2004, their first independent recording.

The album's style is a big departure from the electronic rock sound that was present in Candyass and Vapor Transmission, leaning more to an aggressive nu metal sound similar to bands like Korn and Linkin Park. It is also the first Orgy album to feature occasional screaming vocals.
