Freaks, Geeks, and Asperger Syndrome: A User Guide to Adolescence is a non-fiction book about Asperger syndrome published in 2003. The then 13-year-old author, Luke Jackson, has Asperger syndrome himself. Jackson wrote the book because he felt there was not enough useful information on the Internet about the subject.

Jackson is the son of fellow writer Jacqui Jackson, and most of his siblings have similar difficulties.

Reception
David Worling of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry said that the book is filled with valuable information and is useful to have in a clinical library.

The book received first place in Times Educational Supplement awards in 2003 for special educational needs books.
