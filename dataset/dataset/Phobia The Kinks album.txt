Phobia is the twenty-fourth and final studio album by the English rock group the Kinks, released in 1993. It was their final studio album before their disbandment three years later and stands as their most recent album to date. It is also the only studio album credited to the Kinks which does not feature drummer Mick Avory in any capacity; though he left the band in 1984, he still played on individual songs on both Think Visual and UK Jive. The album was produced by Ray Davies himself as R. Douglas Davies.
