Critical response
Film critic Alexander Fedorov noted:
Valery Pendrakovsky is not one of the elite of Russian directing, but having the classical dramaturgy of Nikolai Erdman as a literary basis and having collected a bouquet of famous actors, he quite convincingly created on the screen a phantasmagoric world of a  universal  communal apartment in which  every creature lives in a couple.
