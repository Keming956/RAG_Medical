History

Formation and growth
Insomnia has grown from a single location in a Galway bookstore in 1997 to an estate of 150+ coffee shops  with owned stores and franchised stores, through partnerships with SPAR, Eurospar, Mace and Londis as well as other Irish retailers such as Eason, Fresh, Meadows & Byrne, Maxol, and Primark.

In 2003, the company merged with the sandwich company, Bendini & Shaw. In 2005, Insomnia acquired the Perk coffee chain.

From 2006-2017, the company was equally owned by chairman Bobby Kerr, CEO Harry Oâ€™Kelly, and John Clohisey. In 2010, O'Kelly was appointed CEO and Kerr became chairman. In December 2017, Bobby Kerr left the business and sold his shares to the other shareholders. That same month, John Clohisey became Chairman, CFO Barry Kehoe joined the Board of Directors and Dara O'Flynn joined as COO.

In April 2012, the Insomnia high street franchise was launched. The first franchise store was opened in 2013 in St Stephens Green Shopping Centre, Dublin.
In 2015, the company announced a new partnership with Primark, an Irish-based retail chain, which trades in Ireland as Penneys. In 2015, three Insomnia concession stores were rolled out at Penneys in Waterford, Swords and Athlone, with Liffey Valley opening in 2016.

In 2016 a new franchise partnership developed between Insomnia and Maxol, which saw the first store opening in Mulhuddart Service Station in April 2016. In 2018 Insomnia's first  coffee drive-thru opened in partnership with Maxol at Maxol Ballycoolin, in the heart of the Dublin Enterprise Zone.

In 2018, Insomnia launched Mission Compostable  a sustainability programme and marketing campaign which was proposed, by 2021, to divert 15 million takeaway coffee cups and 20 million single use items such as plastic straws, plastic cups and plastic cutlery from landfill.
