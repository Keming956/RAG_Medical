A combined internal medicine and psychiatry residency program is a post-graduate medical education program in the United States, which leads to board eligibility in both internal medicine and psychiatry. That is, a graduate of the residency is both an internist as well as a psychiatrist. The program takes five years of post-graduate medical training. There are 12 such programs in the country, and around eighteen positions available for new applicants.

Graduates of such programs can follow a variety of career paths as Dual Internist/Psychiatrists.
