The International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) is an international suicide prevention organization. Founded by Erwin Ringel and Norman Farberow in 1960, IASP, which is in an official relationship with the World Health Organization, is dedicated to preventing suicidal behaviour and providing a forum for mental health professionals, crisis workers, suicide survivors and other people in one way or another affected by suicidal behaviour. The organization now consists of professionals and volunteers from over 50 countries worldwide.

The IASP also co-sponsors World Suicide Prevention Day on September 10 every year, with the World Health Organization.
