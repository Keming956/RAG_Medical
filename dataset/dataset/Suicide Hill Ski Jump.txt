History
Before the construction of the jump in 1925, numerous other hills and jumps were used for competitions. The first competition that took place in Ishpeming, Michigan was on February 25, 1882.  Since 1887, an annual competition has taken place in the area.  On February 26, 1926, Suicide Hill was opened for its first competition.  The name "Suicide Hill" was given by a local newspaper reporter named Ted Butler after jumper Walter "Huns" Anderson was injured in 1926. Due to this long history of ski jumping in the area, the National Ski Hall of Fame is located in Ishpeming.
