The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology is a monthly academic journal published by the American Psychological Association. Its focus is on treatment and prevention in all areas of clinical and clinical-health psychology and especially on topics that appeal to a broad clinical-scientist and practitioner audience. The editor-in-chief is Joanne Davila (Stony Brook University).

The journal was established in 1937 by the Association of Consulting Psychologists as the Journal of Consulting Psychology. With the expansion of the consulting field, the journal obtained its current name in 1968 to more accurately reflect the research it published and the interests of its readership.

The journal has implemented the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines.  The TOP Guidelines provide structure to research planning and reporting and aim to make research more transparent, accessible, and reproducible.
