Synopsis
Leo Winters is a police officer in San Diego when people with superpowers suddenly start appearing all over the world, leading to a wave of destruction and carnage. He manages to track down a grifter couple who are in possession of a device that helps people "unlock" their superpowers for a sizeable fee. They use the device on him, and he soon finds that he has not only developed superpowers, but a suppressed identity, the extra-dimensional warlord Requiem, has taken over his body.
