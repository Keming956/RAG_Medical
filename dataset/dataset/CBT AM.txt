CBT (540 kHz) is a public radio station in Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It has a news, talk and information format and is the local Radio One affiliate of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

CBT transmits with 10,000 watts using a non-directional antenna. It is a Class A station broadcasting on a Canadian and Mexican clear channel frequency. The transmitter is on Crawley Avenue in Grand Falls-Windsor. Because it is at the bottom of the AM dial and is on a clear channel frequency, CBT's signal can be heard over much of Newfoundland by day. At night, with a good radio, it can be picked up around the Maritime Provinces and Eastern Quebec.

History

CBT launched in 1949 on 1350 AM after the Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland, the pre-Confederation public broadcaster, was absorbed by the CBC when Newfoundland joined Canada. The frequency was changed to 990 in 1956, and then to 540 in 1963 (with 990 being reassigned to CBY in Corner Brook).

Local programming
CBT carries CBG Gander's local morning show, The Central Morning Show hosted by Leigh Anne Power. The Grand Falls-Windsor station, which previously co-produced the program, now contributes reports, with local mobile reporter Kelly Bragg acting as a "de facto" co-host. The station otherwise broadcasts programming from CBN in St. John's during the network's local programming blocks.

Transmitters

On July 9, 2021, the CBC submitted an application to convert CBT to 93.3 MHz with an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts (non-directional antenna with an effective height above average terrain of 193.6 metres).  The application was approved on January 26, 2022.
