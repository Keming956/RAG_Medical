Autism Rocks is a United Kingdom-based charitable organisation founded by Sanjay Shah to raise awareness about autism through charitable music events. All funds raised by Autism Rocks will go to the Autism Research Trust, which in turn supports research by the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University.

Autism Rocks gained international popularity after organising an event with late music artist Prince. The Guardian reported that Prince 'love-bombed' the crowd. Artists such as Zayn Malik, Lenny Kravitz, Snoop Dogg and Ricky Martin have also participated.

With the help of the Dubai government, Autism Rocks is building a permanent venue for music events in Dubai, to be called the Autism Rocks Arena, which can accommodate 25,000 people and 6,000 of them are air-conditioned. The construction is expected to be completed by 2017, and the estimated cost of the venue will be a million UAE dirhams.

Autism Rocks created the Autism Rocks Support Centre, one of the first not-for-profit autism centres in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It opened in 2017, but the Centre shut down in February 2020 amidst the tax fraud probe against Sanjay Shah.
