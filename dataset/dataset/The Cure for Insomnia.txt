The Cure for Insomnia, directed by John Henry Timmis IV, is a 1987 experimental film which was, according to Guinness World Records, the longest running film at the time. This record has since been surpassed by several other films. At 5,220 minutes long (87 hours, or 3 days and 15 hours) in length, the film has no plot, instead consisting of artist L. D. Groban reading his 4,080-page poem A Cure for Insomnia over the course of three and a half days, spliced with occasional clips from heavy metal and pornographic videos.

It was first played in its entirety at The School of the Art Institute in Chicago, Illinois, from January 31 to February 3, 1987, in one continuous showing. It has not been released on DVD or other home video formats and all known copies are considered as lost.
