Production
Filming began in April 1999 in Limerick. The budget was reportedly IRÂ£1.6 million. Most of Corman's films of the 90s went straight to video but he wanted this one released theatrically.

A mansion in Galway was built for the film especially. Corman intended to use this to film a remake of The Hound of the Baskervilles but it was never made.
