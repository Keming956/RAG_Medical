Critical reception
In a review for The New York Times, Caroline Knapp calls the book "a gritty, unflinching look at eating disorders," adding, "Hornbacher is at her best when she zeroes in on the specifics of eating disorders and their origins...Such phenomena aren't new to the literature on eating disorders, but Hornbacher describes them with a stark candor that captures both their pain and underlying purposes."
