The Psychotherapy and Counselling Federation of Australia (PACFA) is the umbrella professional body that plays a self-regulating role in the psychotherapy and counselling industry. It represents the interests of more than 3000 practitioners of various forms of psychotherapy and counselling in Australia. It cooperates with 40 related associations to set and meet standards in all states and territories of Australia.

Goals 
PACFA's vision is to lead the effort to make counselling and psychotherapy widely recognised as a profession.
PACFA's mission is to be the leading professional body for counselling and psychotherapy and an automatic reference point for anyone seeking information on counselling and psychotherapy in the Australia.
PACFA's objectives are:
 to promote and provide education and training for counsellors and/or psychotherapists working in either professional or voluntary settings, whether full or part-time with a view to raising the standards of counselling and/or psychotherapy for the benefit of the community and in particular for those who are the recipients of counselling and/or psychotherapy.
 to advance the education of the public in the part that counselling and/or psychotherapy can play generally and in particular to meet the needs of those members of society where development and participation in society is impaired by mental, physical or social handicap or disability.

Government accreditation
The counselling profession in Australia is currently not government regulated so clients are faced with the task of evaluating qualifications of various counsellors and psychotherapists. PACFA is one of two industry associations that is campaigning for government accreditation of counselling in Australia.
