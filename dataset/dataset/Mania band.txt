Mania was a British pop duo composed of Niara Scarlett and Giselle Sommerville. The two met while contributing songwriting for the British pop production house Xenomania, and formed Mania in 2004. Mania was a joint venture between the record producer Brian Higgins and BMG.

They released only one single, "Looking for a Place", and the #29 UK Singles Chart placing of the lead single  meant that the planned album 'Do You Know Your Daughter's On The Roof?' was never released. Several of their songs, including "Money In My Pocket" and "I'm Not Shy", were covered by the girl group Frank. All of their songs were produced by Higgins and the Xenomania team.
