The European Federation of Families of People with Mental Illness (EUFAMI) is an international non-profit organisation registered in Belgium that primarily advocates on behalf of carers. It was founded in 1992 after a meeting where members from all over Europe "shared their experiences of helplessness and frustration when living with someone with severe mental illness". The organisation is active in lobbying European Union bodies on behalf of its member organisations. It has members in 26 European countries and one non-European country. It is a federation of 41 family associations (including two non-European ones) and 5 other mental health associations.

The vast majority of EUFAMI's funding comes from pharmaceutical companies, including Astrazeneca, Janssen, Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Lundbeck. It works in partnership with many of the same companies and with the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations.
