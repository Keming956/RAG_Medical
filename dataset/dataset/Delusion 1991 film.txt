Delusion is a 1991 American crime thriller film directed by Carl Colpaert.

Plot
An embezzler driving through the Nevada desert picks up a Las Vegas showgirl and her psychotic boyfriend after their vehicle crashes. The boyfriend, a not-very-bright hitman, has no intention of letting him get away with the stolen cash. The philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche plays a minor role toward the film's end.

The L.A. Weekly summarized Delusion's plot thusly: George (Jim Metzler), an executive who's embezzled $450,000 to start his own computer firm in Reno, falls prey instead on dat old debbil road to a flaky Mafia contract killer named Chevy (Kyle Secor) and his lippy sidekick (Jennifer Rubin).[33] A collaboration between Voss and the film's debut director, Carl Colpaert,"Delusion" was featured in Paper Magazine's 'Best of Guide', where film critic Dennis Dermody called it "...A nerve-racking desert noir thriller...a moody and unnerving film."[34] Gary Franklin from KABC-TV said, "...It's A 10!...A major sleeper...Trust me - See 'Delusion.'"[35] Critic Stuart Klawans of The Nation wrote, "It's a delight...Discover and cherish.".[36] Village Voice's Georgia Brown claimed: "An auspicious first film...(that) easily beats most of the studio competition."[37] Terry Kelleher of Newsday opined: "A 90's film noir...visually striking and refreshingly feminist."[38] Seattle Times writer John Hartl said: "An amusingly twisty, and entertaining film noir homage."[39] Debut actress Jennifer Rubin also earned acclaim, Playboy resident critic Bruce Williamson asserting,"...Jennifer Rubin steals every scene she has."[40] Boston Globe writer Robin Adam Sloan agreed, writing, "Jennifer Rubin has charged the screen with sex appeal."[41] Kevin Thomas of the L.A. Times wrote, "The clever way in which Colpaert and his co-writer Kurt Voss bring "Delusion" to its conclusion allows the film to wryly comment on the capacity of two seemingly very different men to give way to a macho posturing that reveals money is more important than any person,"[42] Daily News film critic Bob Strauss adding, "'Delusion's' climactic sequence injects contemporary strains of greed any misogyny into a classic western motifâ€”it's funny and a little frightening to see that the frontier is not only open, but getting wider."[43]
