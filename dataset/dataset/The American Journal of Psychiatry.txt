The American Journal of Psychiatry is a monthly peer-reviewed medical journal covering all aspects of psychiatry, and is the official journal of the American Psychiatric Association.

According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2020 impact factor of 18.112.

Ethical concerns
Several complaints, including legal cases, have charged The American Journal of Psychiatry with being complicit in pharmaceutical industry corruption of clinical trial results.  In a Department of Justice case against Forest Pharmaceuticals, Forest pleaded guilty to the charges of misbranding the drug Celexa (citalopram). The Complaint in Intervention clearly identifies a 2004 ghostwritten article published in ‘’The American Journal of Psychiatry in the names of Wagner et al'' as a part of this illegal marketing of Celexa for pediatric depression.
