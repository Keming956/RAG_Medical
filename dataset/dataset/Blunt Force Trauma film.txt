Premise
Pinto plays a woman looking for her brother's killer. The film is based on a banned shooting game, revolving around duelists using kevlar vests. The rules are that one may not aim for lethal shots, and that should one fall out of a predesignated ring which each contestant is stood in, they lose. You may also tap out, similar to other combat sports.
