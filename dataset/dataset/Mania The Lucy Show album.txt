Mania was released in 1986 in the UK and the U.S. on Big Time Records.  It was The Lucy Show's second, and final, album.  The band changed direction from the richly atmospheric and melancholy ...undone and aimed for a more upbeat,  commercial sound.  The album received better critical reviews than the debut album, and sold more copies, topping the CMJ charts in the US and earning some MTV airplay for the music video of the song, "A Million Things".  However, Big Time Records went bankrupt, leaving The Lucy Show once again without a label.  They continued to tour and record for some time, then called it quits in 1988.  In 2005, the Words on Music label issued the album on CD for the first time, adding several bonus tracks.
