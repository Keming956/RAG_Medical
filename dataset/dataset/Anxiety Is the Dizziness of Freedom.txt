Plot summary
In the near future, quantum mechanics and computer technology have discovered a parallel reality to humanity, creating divergent timelines and allowing communication between them. The old dream of knowing your own fate and that of the whole world, if you had chosen a different path one day, came true. The ability to alternate timelines forced the society into a severe existential crisis.
