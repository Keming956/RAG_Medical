Trauma is a 1962 American film directed by Robert M. Young and starring Lynn Bari and John Conte.

Plot  
Eight years after her aunt Helen Garrison is killed, newlywed niece Emmaline and husband Warren return to the home where Helen died, where Emmaline tries to recall events from that fateful night that her mind has blacked out.
