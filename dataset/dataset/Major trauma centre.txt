A major trauma centre (MTC) is a specialist unit within the National Health Service of the United Kingdom, set up to provide specialised trauma care and rehabilitation. They are usually found within larger hospitals in major cities which have the necessary infrastructure and staff to deal with major trauma cases.

MTCs provide emergency access to life and limb saving consultant-led care in a wide range of specialisms including anaesthetics, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, geriatricians and emergency medicine. All MTCs have an on-site CT scanner and emergency operating theatres on standby to perform immediate, life-saving surgery. All MTCs also provide consultant-led rehabilitation care, to optimise recovery at the earliest opportunity.

Major trauma is described as life-altering injury with risk of death and/or disability.

The first major trauma centre opened in England in 2012, with Scotland following in 2018, and in the same year plans were announced for the first MTC in Wales.

England
There are 27 major trauma centres within NHS England, in three categories: adult and children; adult only; and children only. At first a small number of pilot sites were trialled. All major trauma centres in England operate within local trauma networks, ensuring patients are treated at the most appropriate place for their injuries, but returning to care closer to home when able.

The first MTCs opened in April 2012.

Scotland

The Scottish Trauma Network operates four major trauma centres within NHS Scotland. The first was opened at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary on 1 October 2018.

Wales

Northern Ireland
