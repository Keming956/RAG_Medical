The Maia Chung Autism and Disabilities Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation in Jamaica which was formed to help people affected by autism and other disabilities as well as to support entities that help these persons function.

The Foundation has collected about 12 million Jamaican dollars in funds and resources to assist with helping existing treatment facilities, schools and families.

Programs
The Autism and Disabilities Foundation has given financial support to The Promise Learning Centre, an academic institution in operation for 15 years in Jamaica which specialises in the treatment of autism and other learning disabilities.

The Foundation is now working exclusively with the Adonijah Schools, an organisation that specialises in teaching children with autism, located in Kingston, Jamaica.
 
The Foundation also helps persons who live outside Kingston, where treatment facilities are concentrated, to travel there for treatment, and seeks to have the government offer medical treatment programmes in the parishes where there is now no formal or too limited types of medical care for these persons.
