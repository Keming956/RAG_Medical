Reception
Richard A. Edwards reviewed Paranoia Excessory Pack in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 81. Edwards commented that "I think West End has given us a selection of gimmicks for which no GM will hold off on obtaining, but I wish they would have included an adventure, a mini-adventure even, to make me feel like I was getting more for my money than some extra copies of forms."
