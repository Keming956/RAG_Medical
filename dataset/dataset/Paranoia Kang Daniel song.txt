"Paranoia" is a song by South Korean singer Kang Daniel. It was released digitally by Konnect Entertainment on February 16, 2021 and was later included in his fourth EP Yellow on April 13, 2021.

Background and composition
During an online press conference held to commemorate the single's release, Kang expanded on the meaning of "Paranoia" by sharing that "The theme in itself is heavy and distant, but since I'm resolving feelings I've personally felt, I wanted to express them honestly. I believe this is a feeling everyone can relate to, there's only a difference in the extent and the depth." He continued by saying "The reason I put focus on such a dark aspect is because the majority of people are reluctant to bring this up. I wanted to confess my inner concerns and communicate them." The single resurrects Kang's battle with those who tormented him through cyberbullying and the inner demons that subsequently sprang to life.

"Paranoia" combines synth bells, 808 bass, and an electric guitar. In an interview with fashion-industry trade journal WWD, Kang revealed that he drew inspiration for the various tracks on Yellow from his personal experiences during a difficult period in his career and is credited as the main lyricist for the pre-released single "Paranoia".
