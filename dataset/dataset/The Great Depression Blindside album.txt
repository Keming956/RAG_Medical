The Great Depression is the fifth studio album from post-hardcore band Blindside.  It is their first album for DRT Entertainment.  The album was largely influenced by a trip to Africa that their lead singer, Christian, had undertaken.  He was very unsettled by his experience and the things he saw influenced the album immensely. The song "Yemkela" was written about a young African boy he met on his trip.  The boy had HIV and had less than two months to live. However, in a recent interview, Christian Lindskog revealed that on a recent tour in South Africa, he had seen Yemkela (who Christian expected would be dead) at a show in Cape Town. To Christian's surprise, he was doing well and watched Blindside perform his song and sang along. This Performance was released on a documentary packaged with Blindside's 2011 album "With Shivering Hearts We Wait."
