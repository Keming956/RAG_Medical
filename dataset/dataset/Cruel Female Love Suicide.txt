is an April 1970 Japanese film directed by Shōgorō Nishimura and starring Annu Mari and Sanae Ōhori. The major Japanese film studio Nikkatsu began to experiment with erotic-themed movies beginning in the late 1960s in an attempt to save the company from insolvency. Cruel Female Love Suicide continued this trend which eventually resulted in the inauguration of Nikkatsu's Roman porno series of films in November 1971 with Apartment Wife: Affair In the Afternoon, also directed by Shōgorō Nishimura.
