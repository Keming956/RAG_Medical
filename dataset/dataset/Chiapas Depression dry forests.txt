The Chiapas Depression dry forests form one of the ecoregions that belong to the tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests biome, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund, in northwestern Central America.

Geography
This ecoregion is located in the central Chiapas Depression, which lies between the Chiapas Highlands on the north and the Sierra Madre de Chiapas to the south. The Chiapas Depression is mostly within Chiapas state of Mexico, and extends into northwestern Guatemala. The depression is drained by the Grijalva River.

It covers an area of around 13,900 km2. It lies at an altitude of .

Climate
The Chiapas Depression dry forests ecoregion has a hot, dry climate.

Ecology
Its biodiversity is high, with about 980 plant species, and includes 40% of the endemic species of dry ecosystems found in Mexico. It also forms a corridor that connects two major biogeographic region, the Gulf of Mexico on the east and the Pacific in the west.

Conservation and threats
The ecoregion has been seriously threatened by cattle grazing, which is the main cause of its destruction, along with the effects of logging and the expansion of the agricultural frontier.

Protected areas
A 2017 assessment found that 309 km², or 2%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas in the ecoregion include Sumidero Canyon National Park and a portion of La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve.
