Pre-race news
John Andretti, after finishing 16th in the Indianapolis 500, returned to the #34 Chevrolet of Front Row Motorsports replacing Jeff Green.
With Dario Franchitti sitting out again this week (he would run in the NNS race the day before,) Jeremy Mayfield got a one-off try in the #40 Chip Ganassi Racing Dodge, qualifying an impressive 10th.
Robby Gordon, owner/driver of the #7 Dodge, was in Baja 500 this weekend, so Craftsman Truck Series driver Matt Crafton subbed for Gordon in qualifying and practice on Friday and Saturday.  No matter what happened, the #7 Dodge started in the back as the owner is expected to drive on Sunday.
