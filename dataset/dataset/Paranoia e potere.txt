Paranoia e Potere (in English Paranoia and Power) is the first official album of the Italian band Punkreas.

Made up of thirteen new songs, Paranoia e Potere became the album which introduced Punkreas in the mainstream Italian punk scene. The album was recorded in a month in analogue. The low quality of the technology made the sound more rough and hard, making the album more hardcore.
