The Autism Research Centre (ARC) is a research institute that is a part of the Department of Developmental Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge, England.

ARC's research goal is to understand the biomedical causes of autism spectrum conditions, and to develop new and validated methods for assessment and intervention. The ARC collaborates with scientists both within Cambridge University and at universities in the UK and around the world. Professor Simon Baron-Cohen is the director of the ARC and Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at the University of Cambridge, as well as being a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.

Autism Research Trust
The organization known as the Autism Research Trust (ART) exists to support the ARC and promote the general cause of scientific investigation into autism. Prominent individuals associated with the trust include scientific writers such as Lucy Hawking, the daughter of Stephen Hawking.

The ARC has remarked in a statement, "Understanding of autism has developed a great deal over recent years, but there is still a huge amount of work to be done. We cannot leave the responsibility for this research to future generationsâ€“ we have a responsibility to play our part now."
