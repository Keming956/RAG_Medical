The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts and supports research to better understand traumatic brain injury and the biological mechanisms underlying damage to the brain, to develop strategies and interventions to limit the primary and secondary brain damage that occurs within days of a head trauma, and to devise therapies to treat brain injury and help in long-term recovery of function.
