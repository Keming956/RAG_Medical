A suicide is a sudden drop to a breakdancer's and B-boys back. They are frequently employed as take out moves burn moves and freeze. Ideally, suicides are very flashy and painful-looking moves. Good suicides elicit exclamations of "ouch" from onlookers and can even be comical to a certain degree. They usually end with the breaker perfectly still, enhancing the image that he has injured himself. Despite appearances, different training and techniques are used to minimize the pain of suicides. A suicide is also used to demonstrate a possible ending to a conflict that groups may have with each other.

Suicides compared to Freezes
Suicides have elements in common with freezes. However, while both suicides and freezes end with a cessation of movement, there is a large distinction to be made. Freezes are precisely controlled techniques meant to draw attention to the actual frozen position. Suicides draw attention while in motion, convey an impression of being dangerously out-of-control, and often leave the breaker lying prone on the floor in an unremarkable position.
