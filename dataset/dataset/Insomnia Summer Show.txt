The Insomnia Summer Show was an event held by Insomnia Club and Attila Gergely on Saturday, July 18, 2009 at the Olimpia Stadium in Satu Mare, Romania. It featured a beauty contest, a martial arts tournament and three concerts. The announcer for the show was the famous Romanian actor and comedian Sorin Tănase from Baia Mare.

The beauty contest was free to join and many local participants enrolled, including models from the modelling agency, Gaby's Models. There were three concerts held, the first concert was from the Hungarian rock band Slager Duo, the second was performed by La Familia hip-hop singer Puya and the last concert which closed the event was performed by the Romanian electronic rock group Voltaj.

One of the main events of the show was the martial arts tournament which featured five mixed martial arts (MMA) fights that took place in an eight-sided cage located in the middle of the stadium. There were only two categories, under and over . The referees were Vasile Fușle and Gergely Attila, notable national and international judo referees. The first match was between Cristian Pintea and Cristian Nichita, two kick-boxing contenders that ended after five minutes after Nichita submitted from Pintea's rear naked choke.

The following two matches ended with a unanimous decision from the referees. The fourth match was the shortest in the tournament, ending after only seven seconds when Raul Maghiar broke his foot after a throw from the winner Zenobiu Mic, a judoka. The last match was the second shortest, lasting two minutes, the winner being Gică Apostu with a submission technique called a guillotine.
