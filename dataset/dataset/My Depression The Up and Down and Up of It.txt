Critical response 
The New York Times described the film "as charming and whimsical a discussion of depression as you’re likely to find... it's honest and forthright as it talks about a condition often misunderstood and misrepresented." BroadwayWorld commented, "Simultaneously heartfelt and entertaining, My Depression illuminates the symptoms, emotions and side effects of the disorder through witty animation, comedy and unique musical numbers."
