The International Early Psychosis Association (IEPA) is a professional body and international network for those with a professional interest in early psychosis intervention.

History 
The need for a professional network was proposed at a conference in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, in June 1997, and then the association was formed in 1998.

Aims 
The objectives of the IEPA, as listed on their website.  They include enhancing the awareness of early psychosis and the process of recovery, providing a collaborative network for stakeholders, and contributing to the development of knowledge, research, and best practice for early psychosis.

Executive group and membership
The IEPA is governed by a group of officers, elected by members every two years.  Membership of the association is free and open to anyone with an interest in early intervention. Membership may be applied for online via a web-based application form.  There are over 7,000 members as of 2020.
