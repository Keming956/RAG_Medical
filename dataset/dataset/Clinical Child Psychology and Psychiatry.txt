Since its inception it has continued to provide a valued resource for clinicians under the editorship of Bernadette Wren, Arlene Vetere Rudi Dallos and now Michael Tarren-Sweeney and Anna Brazier. The journal continues to aim to share creative and innovative work across disciplines in a way that gives voice to experience in practice.
