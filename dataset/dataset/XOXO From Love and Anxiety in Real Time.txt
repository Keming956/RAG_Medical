Critical reception

The album received positive critical reception with Augusta Battoclette of Alternative Press stating that "...the group only further prove that they hardly ever miss when it comes to their music". idobi's Sam Devotta claimed that the band had "once again delivered an album that perfectly sums up what it means to be human". Her review regards the album as a "product of huge changes in their personal lives (weddings, babies, moving out of state)" as well as a record that allowed them "to explore, to bring in new inspirations and try something different, while still delivering the pop rock-infused anthems they’re known for".
