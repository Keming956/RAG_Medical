Game

The game is a remake of the 1991 Commodore 64 game Skærmtrolden Hugo, which was itself based on the first season (1990) labyrinth scenario from the TV game show Hugo, but featuring all-new graphics and gameplay system. Unlike the original, the game also includes the evil witch Scylla (here renamed as "Sculla" and accompanied by her servant Don Croco from the Hugo Jungle Island series), complete with the "Rope" end game from Hugo games for the Amiga, PC and PlayStation.

Reception
The game found 170,000 Danish customers in the first seven weeks on the market and was number one in countries such as Germany, Austria, Norway, Thailand, Chile, Turkey and Poland. It won the 2011 Best App Ever Awards in the Best Kids Game category, Android division. Since August 2012, it is now available for free at App Store.
