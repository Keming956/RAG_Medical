Battle Hymns is the second album by the Detroit, Michigan punk rock band The Suicide Machines, released in 1998 by Hollywood Records. It was the band's last album with drummer Derek Grant, who left the group the following year. The album's musical direction continued the band's style of ska punk but moved in more of a hardcore direction, with most songs lasting under two minutes in and consisting of fast, aggressive musicianship and vocals. A music video was filmed for the single "Give" and the song was featured in the Disney Channel motion picture Brink! The album peaked at #127 on the Billboard 200.
