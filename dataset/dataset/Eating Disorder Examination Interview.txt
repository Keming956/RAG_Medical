The Eating Disorder Examination Interview (EDE) devised by Cooper & Fairburn (1987) is a semi-structured interview conducted by a clinician in the assessment of an eating disorder.

EDE
The EDE is a semi-structured interview conducted by a trained clinician to assess the psychopathology associated with the diagnosis of an eating disorder. The EDE is rated through the use of four subscales and a global score. The four subscales are:

1. Restraint
2. Eating concern
3. Shape concern
4. Weight concern 
 
The questions concern the frequency in which the patient engages in behaviors indicative of an eating disorder over a 28-day period. The test is scored on a 7-point scale from 0-6. With a zero score indicating not having engaged in the questioned behavior.

EDE-Q

The Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) was adapted from the EDE. The EDE-Q is a 28 item self-report questionnaire. It retains the format of the EDE including the 4 subscales and global score. It also concerns behaviors over a 28-day time period and retains the scoring system of 0-6, with 0 indicating no days, 1=1–5 days, 2=6–12 days, 3=13–15 days,
4=16–22 days, 5=23–27 days and 6= every day.
