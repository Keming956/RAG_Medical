History
During a car ride, Dave Hagan and his son were building the idea of a horror convention. By the end of the ride, the two had come up with the main structure for Monster-Mania. Monster-Mania was founded in 1999 by Dave Hagan, through Dave Hagan Enterprises, dedicated to the memory of Hagan's father, who introduced him to horror movies. Its first convention was held on late 2003, in Clarion Hotel and Conference Center in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. The lineup included Doug Bradley (who would become a regular for Monster-Mania Con), Caroline Munro, Ben Chapman, Veronica Carlson, amongst many others.

Events
Monster-Mania Con's main focus is on its guest panels, where one can meet actors from film, television, amongst more. There are also film presentations, previews, photo ops, music performances, and Q&As with select guests, along with a celebrity auction.
