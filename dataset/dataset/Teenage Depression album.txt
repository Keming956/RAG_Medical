Teenage Depression is the debut studio album by English rock band Eddie and the Hot Rods. The album was mixed by Jonz:A and R Howard Thomson and produced by Ed Hollis and Vic Maile. It reached number 43 on the UK Albums Chart.

The album's title track reached number 35 on the UK Singles Chart and was featured in the 1979 film Rock 'n' Roll High School. The album contains three cover songs, The Who's "The Kids Are Alright", Joe Tex's "Show Me", and Sam Cooke's "Shake".

Teenage Depression has been cited as a "missing link" between pub rock and punk rock, owing to its fast and hard-hitting R&B sound showing the attitude of a punk band. In 2000, a reissue was released with 12 additional tracks.
